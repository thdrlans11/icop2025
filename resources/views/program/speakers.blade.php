					<p>Prof. Shin has made significant contributions to the systematics of ciliate protistology and was the president of the Korean Society of Protistologists (KSOP) and the Korean Society of Systematic Zoology (KSSZ). Over three decades, he and his collaborators have focused on the species diversity and phylogeny of the ciliated protists. For more than six years, he served as an Editor-in-Chief of the journal (Animal Systematics, Evolution and Diversity, ASED) of the KSSZ. He currently serves as Subject (Protozoa) Editor of the journal Zootaxa and as an Editorial Board Member of the Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology.

					<p>Andrew has made important contributions to evolutionary protistology and was the founding Director of the Centre for Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Bioinformatics at Dalhousie University (now the Institute of Comparative Genomics, icgenomics.ca).  Over two and a half decades, Andrew and his collaborators have employed comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and other ‘omic’ approaches to clarifying how eukaryotic cells and their symbiont-derived organelles originated and diversified in the past ~2 billion years.  Other topics of particular interest include adaptations to low oxygen conditions in anaerobic protists and clarifying the role of lateral gene transfer in these adaptations, as well as the development methods and models for ‘deep-time’ phylogenetic inference. Andrew has published more than 200 peer-reviewed articles in these fields and has received numerous accolades for his work, including being appointed as a Tier I, Canada Research Chair,  and receiving an award of a Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada.</p>

						Shan is a leading scientist in the field of epigenetics, by using the ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila as the model system. Her current research focuses on understanding the regulation mechanism of DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA), as well as the functional divergence and biological significance of 6mA in eukaryotes. Her work has provided key evidence supporting eukaryotic 6mA as a bona fide epigenetic mark and has offered new insights into the divergent evolution of eukaryotes from the unique perspective of DNA methylation. She has won the Hunter Award and the Holz-Conner Award from the International Society of Protistologists. She is currently the Vice Chair of Ciliate Advisory Board and the Executive Council member of Chinese Society of Protozoology.

						Laura is an evolutionary microbiologist focusing on the origin and evolution of eukaryotes, with particular emphasis on the archaeal ancestry of eukaryotes, the origin and evolution of mitochondria, and the development of key eukaryotic cellular systems during eukaryotic diversification. Dr. Eme has a strong background in molecular phylogenetics and comparative genomics, which she uses to study the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells, focusing on microbial diversity. She explores topics such as the archaeal ancestry of eukaryotes, mitochondrial evolution, endosymbiosis, horizontal gene transfer, and the ecological forces driving genomic diversity. She was awarded the 2023 Hutner Prize by ISOP for her contributions to understanding the origins and early evolution of eukaryotes. Laura is also an Associate Editor for several journals in molecular evolution including Genome Biology and Evolution, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution and Journal of Molecular Evolution.

						Anna is a leading expert in endosymbiosis and the evolution of organelles in protists. 
						Her team focuses on the evolution of eukaryotic cells, the study of the diversity of microbial
						eukaryotes and the investigation of their interactions with other microorganisms, with
						symbiosis being a central theme. Her research interests include the origin and evolution of
						endosymbiotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as the
						endosymbioses of various microbial eukaryotes. By unravelling the complexity of these
						relationships, she aims to deepen our understanding of endosymbiosis and its impact on
						ecosystem functioning. Anna has published in prestigious journals such as PNAS, Current
						Biology, and Molecular Biology and Evolution. She has received numerous national awards
