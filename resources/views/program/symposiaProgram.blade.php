                        Never before has protist sequencing data been easier to acquire, nor has taxon sampling and cultivation been so widespread. With this, new deep-branching protist lineages have been added to the eukaryotic tree of life at an unprecedented pace, the most intriguing of these might be predatory protists. Predatory protists  that specialize in eating other eukaryotic cells  have reshaped our understanding of protists role in ecological food webs and the environment. Unexpectedly, novel predatory lineages have caused a significant restructuring of the eukaryotic tree of life, yet little is known about their prevalence, lifestyle, or evolutionary history. Here, we will discuss recent findings on novel predatory protists, their diversity, cultivation and feeding mechanisms, and their impacts on eukaryotic phylogeny.

                      Protists exhibit extraordinary plasticity in sensing and responding to environmental cues, allowing them to thrive across diverse ecological niches. Through sophisticated sensory receptors and signalling pathways, protists detect changes in physical conditions (e.g. viscosity, light, or spatial cues), chemical factors (e.g. nutrient availability, toxins or salinity), interactions with other organisms, and changes in their internal environment. These sensory cues can trigger rapid behavioural and/or morphological transitions that lend themselves to biophysical studies. Beyond their immediate adaptive responses, the coupling of sensory pathways, biophysics and behaviour underpins major ecological and evolutionary processes, including predation, symbiosis, motion, complex life cycles, and multicellularity.This symposium unites experts from diverse fields to delve into the remarkable and varied behavioural and cellular changes that protists undergo as they interact with their environments. We have sought to choose speakers who research different types of stimuli - including light, gravitational, and mechanical signals - as well as diverse types of behavioural responses. Collectively, they study a broad cross-section of protistan diversity, including green algae, dinoflagellates, myxomycetes, ciliates, and apusomonads.

                        Retaria, composed of the sister taxa Radiolaria and Foraminifera, are large protists that evolved since the Precambrian and are renowned for their extensive fossil record. While historically studied by paleontologists, Retaria have gained the attention of biologists in the last decade, revealing critical roles in biogeochemical cycles, their potential as models to study symbiosis, and their utility as sentinels of ongoing environmental change. Despite being relatively easy to observe and capture, Retaria are challenging to culture and maintain under controlled conditions due to their free-living and predatory nature. Additionally, their diverse communities of symbionts complicate single-cell genomic approaches, preventing a deeper understanding of basic aspects of their biology such as their life cycle. To better understand their role in the trophic network, their evolution, and to stimulate research on these fascinating organisms, we propose a symposium to showcase current research on living Retaria and other large protists, promoting collaboration and identifying novel research approaches. This event will also provide an opportunity to synthesize existing knowledge and outline future research directions to enhance our understanding of these enigmatic and ecologically significant organisms.

                        Dinoflagellates are a specialised, diverse group of protists that are found ubiquitously in the environment. They range from coral reef symbionts, bloom-forming algae, to parasites, encompassing a broad spectrum of trophism and habitat range. Despite their notoriously complex genomes atypical of eukaryotes, the past decade has seen a significant increase in the use of omics approaches to study dinoflagellates, and more genome and genome-scale data are becoming available. These approaches are revolutionising our understanding of the diversification, adaptation and ecological roles of dinoflagellates. This symposium will showcase the latest breakthroughs from omics research to understand the biology, ecology, and evolution of dinoflagellates, including their interacting partners in a tightly linked symbiosis or a functional ecological unit (i.e., holobiont). Topics covered will include biological and evolutionary processes that underpin stress responses, symbiotic/parasitic interactions, toxin production, and bloom dynamics, especially in the context of climate change and warming oceans. Innovative techniques, including single-cell and multi-omics strategies, will also be highlighted. Through interdisciplinary discussions, this symposium will foster collaboration and spark new research directions to deepen our understanding how dinoflagellates shape—and are shaped by—their environments.

                        Volcanic hot springs are some of the most inhospitable locations for life on our planet, with organisms at these sites exposed to extremes of high temperature and salt concentrations, low pH, and toxic levels of heavy metals. Despite these harsh conditions, volcanic hot springs are considered “cradles of microbial life” on the early Earth and therefore provide models for understanding how life may have evolved on exoplanets. With Bacteria and Archaea often considered the sole inhabitants of these habitats, the role of eukaryotes and viruses has been largely overlooked. This symposium will showcase the latest research on the microbial communities which inhabit these extreme volcanic hot springs, with a focus on eukaryote dominated systems and the integration of different experimental approaches to generate a comprehensive picture of the robust microbial communities which inhabit these sites. Topics covered will include the structure, composition, function, and physiology of resident extremophilic microbes. Community wide detoxification, cell cycle-environment interactions, and advanced imaging will also be highlighted. This symposium will foster collaboration and spark new research directions to deepen our understanding of how life evolved to thrive in volcanic hot springs.

                        Microscopy is one of the most important research methods in protistology for the collection and analysis of scientific data. At the same time, the cellular structure of protists and their diversity is remarkable as the beauty of nature's creation. In other words, in many ways, microscopic science in protistology is an exploration of this beauty and the mechanisms that created it. One of the most notable recent advances in microscopy technology is cryo-electron microscopy. In the field of TEM, it is now possible to observe the intact shape of biological specimens by directly observing frozen specimens at low temperatures after quick freezing. Techniques to study the three-dimensional structure of cells and cellular structures using electron tomography and volume microscopy in combination with FIB-SEM and SBF-SEM have also become common. In the field of SEM, a water freeze-drying method was developed that allows observation of unfixed cells with very few artifacts. In addition, micro-CT has been used for 3D structural analysis of some protists. The purpose of this symposium is to share with participants the details of these state-of-the-art microscopy techniques and to appreciate the unique beauty of the protist cells and cellular structures exhibited by these techniques.

                        Protists harbor a tremendous diversity of  morphology, physiology, behaviors, and life strategies. For many of  the existing and described protistan species this diversity can be  compiled in the form of traits and modalities. These traits relate to  the functional diversity of protists, allowing to predict their  performance and role in ecosystems. The main aim of this session is to  present past, ongoing, and future works involved in the development or  the use of trait approaches in the field of protistan ecology, from  the population to the cross-community-levels. Building a census of all  described protistan species and their traits based on a shared  ontology is an achievable goal and a great perspective to gain and  share knowledge on protists biology, ecology and evolution at large.

                        One of the most intriguing characteristics of ciliate protozoa is their dual nuclear system and distinctive sexual reproduction through conjugation. During this process, the micronucleus, which functions as the germline genome, undergoes extensive genome-wide DNA elimination as it differentiates into the somatic macronucleus. The precise regulatory mechanisms governing DNA elimination, as well as the variations in this process across different ciliate species, represent compelling areas of research in genome dynamics and epigenetic regulation. This session will bring together four researchers who utilize different ciliate models to investigate the molecular mechanisms of DNA elimination from diverse perspectives, including chromatin dynamics, histone methylation, cryptic transcription, and small RNA pathways. Their findings provide significant insights into the molecular basis of nuclear dimorphism and functional differentiation in ciliates.
