                                The fossil record provides the only direct evidence for us to assess the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of early eukaryotes. In this presentation, I will summarize recent advances in the study of eukaryotic fossils from the Proterozoic eon (2500-539 million years ago, Ma), with a focus on the evolution of eukaryote diversity and the origins of major eukaryote clades. Eukaryotes first appeared in the fossil record in the Paleoproterozoic, concurrently with or shortly after the ~2400-2300 Ma Great Oxidation Event. For much of the Mesoproterozoic (1600-1000 Ma) and early Neoproterozoic (1000-720 Ma), the diversity of eukaryotes increased slowly and remained at a relatively low level; this period roughly corresponds to the Boring Billion, - a geological period characterized by relative quiescence in geodynamics, indicating long-term equilibrium of the Earth-life system. However, it is during the Boring Billion when crown-group eukaryotes first appeared in the fossil record and major eukaryote groups diverged, including the Archaeplastida (e.g., Rhodophyta and Viridiplantae), Opisthokonta (e.g., Fungi), SAR or Harosa (Rhizaria and possibly Stramenopila), and Amoebozoa. Despite their early divergences, these eukaryotes apparently did not leave a large ecological footprint in the Mesoproterozoic Earth-life system. The Cryogenian Period (720-635 Ma) following the Boring Billion served as a major divide in eukaryote evolution. After Cryogenian snowball Earth events, eukaryote diversity rose rapidly and featured major diversification and extinction events in the Ediacaran Period (635-639 Ma). It is during the Ediacaran Period when animals diverged and diversified, along with the quick rise and fall of several morphologically distinct groups of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotic groups. The currently available and emerging data from paleontology, phylogenomics, and geochemistry allow us to establish a holistic understanding of the interaction between life and Earth during the Proterozoic eon, - a formative age in the history of our planet. <br><br>

                                Oceanic photosynthetic protists such as diatoms contribute at least 20% of global primary production. Yet, how their genomes evolve under conditions of natural selection to cope with environmental change of the upper ocean has barely been investigated. However, this fundamental knowledge is not only essential to identify mechanisms of how they adapt, but it may also be used to investigate and to predict the evolutionary response of important primary producers to global climate change. To address this knowledge gap, this plenary lecture will introduce the concept of adaptive evolution and how it can be applied to identify evolutionary mechanisms that shape the structure and function of protist genomes using model diatoms as a test case. By applying the approach of experimental evolution to wild-type and genetically modified (CRISPR/Cas genome editing) diatom strains under conditions of natural (temperature change) and artificial selection (DNA mutagen), our work not only revealed mechanisms of adaptive genome evolution in diatoms, but it also has shown that there are hotspots of evolution in the genome depending on the selection pressure imposed. Furthermore, the geography of chromosomes impacts the rise of genetic variants involved in adaptation and population differentiation. If the mechanisms of adaptive evolution in diatoms are conserved across diverse protists and possibly other eukaryotes remains to be identified. <br><br>

                                Despite the fundamental role of cell division in the propagation of cellular life, eukaryotes have evolved a diverse range of strategies to remodel and partition organelles and cellular contents in mitosis. What drives the evolution of mitotic mechanisms? Bridging lab and field expeditions, we use a range of microbial model systems, comparative genomics, imaging and experimental evolution to probe mitotic diversity on short and long evolutionary timescales. I will present our recent work on the rewiring of mitotic mechanisms in deep-branching holozoans, green algae, and slime moulds, and finally our initial efforts to generate a eukaryotic mitotic atlas using expansion microscopy.

                                Jana’s research focuses on beneficial interactions between eukaryotic microbes and
                                bacterial symbionts, particularly those that affect the biogeochemical cycling of
                                nitrogen. 
        
                                Jana and her group study the ecological role, diversity and physiology of protist
                                symbionts in groundwaters, freshwater lakes, and the ocean, using a variety of
                                biogeochemical, molecular and imaging techniques, most notably fluorescent microscopy
                                and nanoSIMS. 
        
                                Jana received her PhD in 2011 from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology,
                                Bremen, Germany. Since 2018, she has been heading the research group ‘Greenhouse Gases’
                                there.

                                Shan is a leading scientist in the field of epigenetics, by using the ciliated protozoa&nbsp;Tetrahymena thermophila&nbsp;as the model system. Her current research focuses on understanding the regulation mechanism of DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA), as well as the functional divergence and biological significance of 6mA in eukaryotes. Her work has provided key evidence supporting eukaryotic 6mA as a&nbsp;bona fide&nbsp;epigenetic mark and has offered new insights into the divergent evolution of eukaryotes from the unique perspective of DNA methylation. She has won the Hunter Award and the Holz-Conner Award from the&nbsp;International Society of Protistologists. She is currently the Vice Chair of Ciliate Advisory Board and the Executive Council member of Chinese Society of Protozoology.

Dr. Eme has a strong background in molecular phylogenetics and comparative genomics,&nbsp;which she uses to study the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells, focusing on microbial diversity. She explores topics such as the archaeal ancestry of eukaryotes, mitochondrial evolution, endosymbiosis, horizontal gene transfer, and the ecological forces driving genomic diversity.&nbsp;She was awarded the 2023 Hutner Prize by ISOP for her contributions to understanding the origins and early evolution of eukaryotes. Laura is also an Associate Editor for several journals in molecular evolution including&nbsp;Genome Biology and Evolution,&nbsp;Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution&nbsp;and&nbsp;Journal of Molecular Evolution.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                Anna is a leading expert in endosymbiosis and the evolution of organelles in protists. 
                                Her team focuses on the evolution of eukaryotic cells, the study of the diversity of microbial
                                eukaryotes and the investigation of their interactions with other microorganisms, with
                                symbiosis being a central theme. Her research interests include the origin and evolution of
                                endosymbiotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as the
                                endosymbioses of various microbial eukaryotes. By unravelling the complexity of these
                                relationships, she aims to deepen our understanding of endosymbiosis and its impact on
                                ecosystem functioning. Anna has published in prestigious journals such as PNAS, Current
                                Biology, and Molecular Biology and Evolution. She has received numerous national awards
                                for her scientific contributions, including the L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award
                                in 2021. Recently, she was recognized as a FEMS European Academy of Microbiology Fellow.
                                Anna is a Past President of the International Society of Protistologists.
